ClosestPair
Implementation of the algorithm ClosestPair which find using DivideAndConquer algorithm the closest pair given a data set, this is made to see its time complexity and the differences between this time complexity and the time complexity that we get for a brutalForce algoritm.
The paper in which the analysis is more detailed, can be found in the repository.
